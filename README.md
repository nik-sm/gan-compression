# TODO
- Niklas will work on:
  - Starting with just a single class from CIFAR10?
  - re-train the BEGAN on some interesting/relevant data
  - figure out the search process

- choose/setup some experiments:
  - different training datasets
  - different target img
  - change latent dim in generator (smaller or larger)
  - try adding artificial noise to the input image
    - cellphone pictures in low lighting
    - try to train the GAN with noise as well?

We can sketch out the experiments, estimate how much effort each one takes, and start with the easiest one(s)
